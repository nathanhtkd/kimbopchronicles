## KimBopChronicles: Personalized News Wrapped in Music üé∂

**KimBopChronicles** is a hybrid **Next.js 14** + **Python** application designed to turn news summaries into personalized songs. By combining AI-generated music and news, users can stay informed in an engaging and fun way‚Äîlistening to the latest headlines wrapped in their favorite musical genre.

### üöÄ **Inputs:**
- **Topics**: A list of topics of interest to the user (e.g., finance, politics, technology).
- **Genre**: The desired musical genre for the song (e.g., rap, pop, folk).
- **Sentiment Preference**: A preference for the overall sentiment of the song: "positive," "negative," or "neutral."

### üéµ **Outputs:**
- **Audio URL**: The link to the generated song audio file.
- **Image URL**: A link to an image representing the song's theme.
- **Avatar Image URL**: A link to an avatar image representing the song's theme, generated by AI.
- **Lyrics**: The lyrics of the generated song, created from the summarized news articles.
- **News Sources**: A list of news articles used as sources for the song, including the title and URL.

### üîß **Usage:**
The application consists of three main components:

1. **Next.js Frontend**:  
   - Handles user interactions, including topic selection, genre selection, and displays the generated song output (audio, lyrics, and images).
   - Built with **Next.js 14** and **TailwindCSS** for a responsive and modern UI.

2. **FastAPI Backend**:  
   - Fetches the top 5 news articles based on user-selected topics using a news aggregator API.
   - Summarizes news content using advanced AI models like **Groq** and **Llama 3.1**.
   - Processes sentiment analysis and generates coherent lyrics from the summarized news content.
   - The backend is built using **FastAPI**, providing robust and scalable backend services.

3. **Suno API for Music Generation**:  
   - Generates music based on the user‚Äôs preferred genre and the AI-generated lyrics.
   - The Suno API produces high-quality, 2+ minute songs that align with the selected music style, and provides the final audio URL.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Tech Stack**:
- **Frontend**: 
  - **Next.js 14** 
  - **Typescript**
  - **TailwindCSS**
- **Backend**: 
  - **FastAPI** 
  - **Python**
  - **Pydantic**
- **APIs/Tools**:
  - **News Aggregator API**: Retrieves the top articles for each topic using [mediastack.com](https://mediastack.com) (or any similar news API).
  - **Groq AI**: Summarizes and processes the content of news articles.
  - **Llama 3.1**: Enhances text summarization and lyric generation.
  - **Suno API**: Deployed instance for music generation available at [Suno Vercel](https://suno.gcui.ai/).
  - **Pollinations.ai**: Creates AI-generated avatars related to the song‚Äôs theme.
  - **Summary API**: For news content extraction via [Pipfeed](https://api.market/store/pipfeed/parse).

### üß† **AI Models Used**:
- **Groq**: Used for summarizing news articles and generating coherent text from them.
- **Llama 3.1**: Utilized for advanced text summarization, sentiment analysis, and generating natural-sounding lyrics.
- **Suno API**: Converts lyrics into music based on the user‚Äôs genre preference, creating a 2+ minute audio track for each topic.

### üíæ **Environment Variables (.env File)**  
To run this project, you need to create a `.env` file in the root directory and include the following keys:

```bash
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
NEWS_API_KEY=your_mediastack_api_key_here
SUNO_API_URL=https://suno.gcui.ai/
SUMMARY_API_KEY=your_pipfeed_summary_api_key_here
```

This `.env` file contains the necessary API keys for:

- **Groq API**: Used for summarizing articles and generating lyrics.
- **News Aggregator API**: Retrieves news articles (we used [mediastack.com](https://mediastack.com), but this can be easily swapped with any similar news API).
- **Suno API URL**: Deployed Suno API instance used for music generation.
- **Summary API**: Used for extracting and parsing news article content.

### üéØ **How It Works**:
1. The user interacts with the **Next.js frontend** to select topics, genre, and sentiment preference.
2. The **FastAPI backend** processes the news articles using **Groq** and **Llama 3.1**, creating a structured lyric format based on the user's preferences.
3. The generated lyrics are sent to the **Suno API**, where a song is composed.
4. Simultaneously, **Pollinations.ai** generates an avatar that sings the news in the selected genre.
5. The user receives the **audio**, **lyrics**, and **visuals** on the frontend, along with links to the news articles used.

### üí° **Why KimBopChronicles?**
KimBopChronicles offers a fresh, entertaining way to consume news. Instead of reading articles, users can listen to personalized songs that wrap up the day's most important events in a fun and interactive way. With a choice of genre and sentiment, every user can curate their news experience to fit their mood and preferences.
