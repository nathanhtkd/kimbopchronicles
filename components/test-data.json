Come and spend the night with someone new Talking with your hands, but do you mean it? Baby, all you gotta do is Say the word I know what you're thinking, but just say it first Been waiting all this time for you to take your turn (yeah) In my arms for a second Baby, say the word, and I'll be yours Say the word (yeah) I know what you're thinking, but just say it first Been waiting all this time for you to take your turn (yeah) In my arms for a second Baby, say the word, and I'll be yours (yeah) Say the word",
